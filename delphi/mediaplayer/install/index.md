# Comprehensive TVFMediaPlayer Library Installation Guide

Welcome to the detailed installation guide for the VisioForge TVFMediaPlayer library, a core component of the powerful All-in-One Media Framework. This guide provides comprehensive steps for installing the library across various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), ensuring you can leverage its rich media playback capabilities effectively in your projects.

The TVFMediaPlayer library offers developers robust tools for integrating audio and video playback, processing, and streaming functionalities into their applications. It is available in two primary forms to cater to different development ecosystems:

1.  **Native Delphi Package:** Optimized specifically for Embarcadero Delphi developers, offering seamless integration, design-time support, and leveraging the full potential of the VCL framework.
2.  **ActiveX Control (OCX):** Designed for broad compatibility, allowing integration into environments that support ActiveX technology, such as C++ Builder, Microsoft Visual Basic 6 (VB6), Microsoft Visual Studio (for C#, VB.NET, C++ MFC projects), and other ActiveX containers.

This dual availability ensures that whether you are working within the Delphi ecosystem or utilizing other popular development tools, you can harness the power of TVFMediaPlayer.

## Before You Begin: System Requirements and Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure your development environment meets the necessary requirements:

## IDE-Specific Integration

After the general installation, you need to integrate the TVFMediaPlayer library into your chosen development environment.

### Delphi (Native Packages)

Using the native Delphi packages provides the best experience for Delphi developers, including design-time component integration.

*   **Detailed Guide:** For comprehensive instructions specific to Delphi, including adding the library path and installing the design-time and runtime packages (`.dpk` files), please refer to the dedicated **[Delphi Installation Guide](delphi.md)**.
*   **Key Benefits:** Direct component palette access, property inspectors, event handlers integrated within the IDE, and optimized performance for VCL applications.

### ActiveX Integration (C++ Builder, VB6, Visual Studio, etc.)

If you are not using Delphi or prefer the ActiveX approach, you'll need to add the `TVFMediaPlayer.ocx` control to your project.

#### C++ Builder

Integrating the ActiveX control in C++ Builder involves importing it into the IDE.

*   **Detailed Guide:** Refer to the **[C++ Builder Installation Guide](builder.md)** for step-by-step instructions on importing the ActiveX control, which typically involves using the IDE's "Import Component" or "Import ActiveX Control" feature to generate necessary wrapper code.
*   **Process Overview:** This usually involves navigating `Component -> Import Component...`, selecting "Import ActiveX Control", finding the "VisioForge Media Player SDK" (or similar name) in the list of registered controls, and letting the IDE generate the corresponding C++ wrapper classes that allow you to interact with the control.

#### Visual Basic 6 (VB6)

VB6 relies heavily on ActiveX technology, making integration straightforward.

1.  **Open Project:** Launch Visual Basic 6 and open your existing project or create a new one.
2.  **Access Components Dialog:** Go to the main menu and select `Project -> Components...`. This will open the Components dialog box, listing registered controls.
3.  **Locate and Select Control:** Scroll through the list under the "Controls" tab. Look for an entry like "VisioForge Media Player SDK Control" or similar (the exact name might vary slightly depending on the version). Check the box next to it.
4.  **Add via Browse (If Not Listed):** If the control is not listed (perhaps due to a registration issue), click the "Browse..." button. Navigate to the VisioForge installation directory (specifically the `Redist\AnyCPU` or similar subfolder containing `TVFMediaPlayer.ocx`) and select the `.ocx` file. Click "Open". This should register and add the control to the list. Ensure its checkbox is ticked.
5.  **Confirm:** Click "OK" or "Apply" in the Components dialog.
6.  **Use Control:** The TVFMediaPlayer icon should now appear in your VB6 Toolbox. You can click and drag it onto your forms to use it visually. You can then interact with its properties and methods via code.

#### Visual Studio (C#, VB.NET, C++ MFC)

Visual Studio manages ActiveX controls through the COM Interoperability layer.

1.  **Open Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your Windows Forms (C# or VB.NET), WPF, or MFC project.
2.  **Open Toolbox:** Ensure the Toolbox is visible (`View -> Toolbox`).
3.  **Add Control to Toolbox:**
    *   Right-click inside the Toolbox, preferably within a relevant tab like "General" or "All Windows Forms", or create a new tab (e.g., "VisioForge").
    *   Select "Choose Items...".
    *   Wait for the "Choose Toolbox Items" dialog to load. This can sometimes take a moment as it scans registered components.
    *   Navigate to the "COM Components" tab.
    *   Scroll through the list and look for "VisioForge Media Player SDK Control" or a similar name. Check the box next to it.
    *   **Add via Browse (If Not Listed):** If you cannot find it, click the "Browse..." button. Navigate to the VisioForge installation directory (usually the `Redist\AnyCPU` subfolder) and select the `TVFMediaPlayer.ocx` file. Click "Open". This should add it to the list; make sure its checkbox is now selected.
    *   Click "OK".
4.  **Use Control:** The TVFMediaPlayer control icon will now be available in your Visual Studio Toolbox. Drag and drop it onto your form (Windows Forms) or use it programmatically (WPF, MFC). Visual Studio will automatically generate the necessary Interop assemblies (wrappers) to allow managed code (.NET) or C++ to interact with the COM-based ActiveX control.

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

Encountering problems during installation? Here are some common issues and solutions:

*   **Control Not Registered / Not Appearing in IDE:**
    *   Ensure the installer was run with administrator privileges.
    *   Try manually registering the OCX file. Open an **Administrator Command Prompt**, navigate to the directory containing `TVFMediaPlayer.ocx` (e.g., `cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\VisioForge\Media Framework\Redist\AnyCPU"`), and run `regsvr32 TVFMediaPlayer.ocx`. A success message should appear.
    *   Check for conflicts with other media libraries or older VisioForge versions. Consider uninstalling previous versions first.
*   **Installation Fails or Rolls Back:**
    *   Ensure you meet all system requirements, including DirectX and .NET versions.
    *   Temporarily disable antivirus software, which might interfere with the registration process. Remember to re-enable it afterward.
    *   Check for sufficient disk space on the target drive.
*   **Issues in Specific IDEs:**
    *   **Delphi:** Ensure the library path is correctly added in `Tools -> Options -> Library Path` and that the correct `BPL` files are installed. Rebuilding packages might help.
    *   **Visual Studio:** Delete the `obj` and `bin` folders in your project, delete any existing Interop assemblies related to VisioForge, remove the control reference, restart Visual Studio, and try adding the control again. Ensure your project targets a compatible .NET Framework version if applicable.
