# Installing TVFVideoEdit ActiveX Control in Visual Basic 6

## Introduction

Visual Basic 6 remains a popular development environment for creating Windows applications. By leveraging our TVFVideoEdit library as an ActiveX control, developers can incorporate advanced video editing and processing capabilities into their VB6 applications without extensive coding.

## Technical Requirements and Limitations

Microsoft Visual Basic 6 operates as a 32-bit development platform and cannot produce 64-bit applications. Due to this architectural constraint, only the x86 (32-bit) version of our library is compatible with VB6 projects. Despite this limitation, the 32-bit implementation delivers excellent performance and provides full access to the library's extensive feature set.

## Installation Process

Follow these detailed steps to properly install the TVFVideoEdit ActiveX control in your Visual Basic 6 environment:

### Step 1: Create a New Project

Begin by launching Visual Basic 6 and creating a new project:

1. Open Visual Basic 6 IDE
2. Select "New Project" from the File menu
3. Choose "Standard EXE" as the project type
4. Click "OK" to create the baseline project

### Step 5: Implement the Control

To begin using the control in your application:

1. Select the TVFVideoEdit control from the toolbox
2. Click and drag on your form to place an instance of the control
3. Size the control appropriately for your interface
4. Access properties and methods through the Properties window and code

## Advanced Implementation Tips

* Set appropriate control properties before loading media files
* Handle events for user interaction and processing notifications
* Consider memory management when working with large video files
* Test your application thoroughly with various media formats
