# WMV Network Streaming Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to implement network-based video broadcasting using Windows Media Video (WMV) format in your Delphi applications. The techniques shown here allow you to stream video content over networks while simultaneously capturing and saving the video to a file for archival purposes.

## Requirements

Before implementing WMV network streaming, ensure that you have:

- A supported video capture device connected to your system
- Proper network access and permissions
- A valid WMV profile file with encoder settings

## Implementation Steps

### Basic Configuration

To enable WMV network streaming in your application, you'll need to configure several essential parameters:

1. Enable network streaming functionality
2. Specify a WMV profile file containing video encoding parameters
3. Set the maximum number of concurrent client connections
4. Define the network port for client connections

### Delphi Implementation Code

```pascal
// Delphi code for configuring WMV network streaming
// Enable the network streaming functionality
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_Enabled := true;

// Set the path to the WMV profile file containing encoder settings
// This file defines video quality, bitrate, resolution, etc.
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_WMV_Profile_FileName := edNetworkStreamingWMVProfile.Text;

// Define maximum number of concurrent clients that can connect
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_Maximum_Clients := StrToInt(edMaximumClients.Text);

// Specify the network port that clients will use to connect
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_Network_Port := StrToInt(edNetworkPort.Text);
```

### C++ MFC Implementation

```cpp
// C++ MFC implementation for WMV network streaming
// Enable streaming functionality
m_VideoCapture.SetNetwork_Streaming_Enabled(true);

// Set WMV profile path - contains encoding parameters
m_VideoCapture.SetNetwork_Streaming_WMV_Profile_FileName(edNetworkStreamingWMVProfile.GetWindowText());

// Define maximum concurrent client connections
m_VideoCapture.SetNetwork_Streaming_Maximum_Clients(_ttoi(edMaximumClients.GetWindowText()));

// Set the network port for client connections
m_VideoCapture.SetNetwork_Streaming_Network_Port(_ttoi(edNetworkPort.GetWindowText()));
```

### VB6 Implementation

```vb
' VB6 (ActiveX) implementation for WMV network streaming
' Enable network streaming capabilities
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_Enabled = True

' Set the profile file containing video encoder settings
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_WMV_Profile_FileName = txtNetworkStreamingWMVProfile.Text

' Define maximum number of clients allowed to connect simultaneously
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_Maximum_Clients = CInt(txtMaximumClients.Text)

' Specify the network port for client connections
VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_Network_Port = CInt(txtNetworkPort.Text)
```

## Client Connection Information

After configuring the streaming parameters, your application can obtain the connection URL that clients will use to access the video stream:

```pascal
// Get the URL that clients will use to connect to the stream
// This URL can be shared with users who need to view the stream
strStreamURL := VideoCapture1.Network_Streaming_URL;
```

This URL can be used with Windows Media Player or any other application that supports Windows Media streaming protocols.

## Best Practices

For optimal streaming performance, consider the following recommendations:

- Use appropriate bitrates based on your network capabilities
- Monitor client connections to ensure system stability
- Test your streaming configuration with various client applications
- Consider network bandwidth limitations when setting quality parameters

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your streaming implementation:

- Verify network firewall settings allow traffic on your selected port
- Ensure the WMV profile file exists and contains valid settings
- Check that the maximum client count is appropriate for your server resources
- Validate network connectivity between the server and potential clients
