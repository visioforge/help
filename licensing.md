# VisioForge SDKs Licensing Guide

## Introduction to Our Licensing Model

Our licensing model is designed with developers in mind, offering a straightforward and cost-effective approach for integrating powerful video and media capabilities into your applications. Each license provides commercial usage rights with no hidden costs or complicated terms, ensuring you can focus on building great software rather than navigating complex licensing structures.

For complete legal details, please refer to our [End User License Agreement (EULA)](eula.md).

## Developer-Based Licensing Framework

We operate on a per-developer licensing model rather than charging per end-user or per deployment. This approach offers several key advantages:

- **Royalty-free deployment**: Once licensed, you can distribute your applications to unlimited end-users without additional fees
- **No runtime licensing**: End-users never need to purchase or manage separate licenses
- **Predictable costs**: Your development team knows the exact licensing cost upfront with no surprise fees

This model is particularly beneficial for commercial applications where you need to distribute your software widely without tracking deployment counts or managing complex licensing servers.

## Understanding License Scope and Requirements

### Team Licensing Requirements

Each developer actively working with the SDK requires their own license when using the One-Year license option. This policy ensures fair usage while supporting our ongoing development efforts. Consider the following scenarios:

- A team of three developers working with the SDK would require three One-Year licenses
- If developers work in shifts (never concurrently), you may be able to share licenses
- Temporary or contract developers must also be covered by appropriate licensing
- For unlimited team usage, consider the Lifetime/Team license option

### Contractor and Agency Arrangements

For contractors and agencies developing on behalf of clients:

- Licenses should be purchased in the name of the contracting company
- The end client typically retains ownership of the license after project completion
- Clear documentation of license ownership should be established in project contracts

## License Types and Duration Options

We offer two primary license types to accommodate different development timelines and budget constraints:

### One-Year License

The one-year license provides a lower entry cost with comprehensive benefits:

- Valid for 12 months from purchase date
- Full access to all product updates released during the license period
- Complete technical support through our developer portal and support channels
- Documentation and sample code access
- License renewal options at the end of the term

When your one-year license expires, you may continue using the last version released during your active license period indefinitely. However, to access new features, bug fixes, and technical support, you'll need to renew your license.

### Lifetime/Team License

The Lifetime/Team license offers long-term value with perpetual usage rights for your entire development team:

- One-time payment with no renewal requirements
- Perpetual access to the product version purchased
- All updates released within the first 12 months included at no additional cost
- Technical support for the first 12 months
- Optional update and support subscription available after the first year
- Coverage for your entire development team without per-developer restrictions

The Lifetime/Team license is ideal for projects with longer development cycles, larger development teams, or when you want to eliminate recurring license costs from your budget.

## Support and Updates Policy

### Support Channels and Availability

During your active license period, you'll have access to:

- Email technical support with guaranteed response times
- Developer forum access
- Priority bug fixes for critical issues
- Implementation guidance and code review assistance

Our support team consists of the same engineers who build the SDK, ensuring you receive expert assistance from professionals who understand the product at its deepest level.

### Update Release Schedule and Access

We maintain a regular update schedule to improve the SDK:

- Major updates approximately every 6 months
- Minor updates and bug fixes released as needed, typically monthly
- Security patches prioritized and released as soon as available
- All updates documented with detailed release notes

Customers with active licenses or update subscriptions can download updates directly from our developer portal immediately upon release.

## License Administration

### License Activation and Management

Managing your licenses is simple through our online portal:

1. Purchase the appropriate number of licenses
2. Receive activation keys via email
3. Download the SDK from our developer portal
4. Apply the license key during installation or in your code
5. Track and manage licenses through your account dashboard

### License Transfers and Reassignment

Licenses can be reassigned within your organization as development needs change:

- Developer transitions can be handled by reassigning licenses
- Company acquisitions or mergers may qualify for license transfers (contact support)
- License keys are tied to your company account, not individual developers

## Deployment Rights and Redistribution

### Application Distribution

Your licensing rights include:

- Distribution of compiled applications to unlimited end-users
- Deployment across multiple environments (development, testing, production)
- Cloud, on-premises, and hybrid deployment options
- No additional runtime licensing requirements

### Source Code and Intellectual Property Protection

While you can distribute applications built with our SDK freely, certain restrictions apply:

- The SDK source code and components cannot be redistributed independently
- Your license does not grant rights to repackage or resell the SDK itself
- Your application's source code and intellectual property remain entirely yours

## Getting Started with Your License

Once you've acquired your license, you can immediately begin development:

1. Install the SDK using your license key
2. Access comprehensive documentation through our developer portal
3. Review sample applications for implementation guidance
4. Join our developer community for additional support

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use one license for multiple projects?

Yes, a single developer license covers all projects by that developer using our SDK.

### What happens if my one-year license expires?

You can continue using the last version released during your active license period, but will lose access to updates and support until renewal.

### Do I need licenses for build servers or CI/CD pipelines?

No, build environment installations don't require separate licenses.

### How do license renewals work?

Renewal notices are sent 30 days before expiration, and renewing maintains continuity of updates and support.
