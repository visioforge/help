## Introduction

VisioForge's powerful .NET SDKs provide comprehensive media processing capabilities for macOS developers. Whether you're building video capture applications, media players, video editors, or complex media processing pipelines, our SDKs offer the tools you need to deliver high-quality solutions on Apple's platforms.

The VisioForge SDK provides comprehensive support for macOS application development using .NET technologies. You can leverage this SDK to build robust media processing applications that run natively on macOS, including support for both Intel (x64) and Apple Silicon (ARM64) architectures.

This guide covers everything you need to know to set up, configure, and deploy applications for macOS and MacCatalyst environments using the VisioForge SDK. Whether you're building traditional macOS applications or cross-platform solutions using frameworks like MAUI or Avalonia, this document will help you navigate the installation and deployment process.

## System Requirements

Before starting the installation and deployment process, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

### Hardware Requirements

- Mac computer with Intel processor (x64) or Apple Silicon (ARM64)
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for video processing)
- Sufficient disk space for development tools and application assets

### Software Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later (latest version recommended)
  - macOS Monterey (12.x)
  - macOS Ventura (13.x)
  - macOS Sonoma (14.x)
  - Future macOS releases (with ongoing updates)
- Xcode 12 or later with Command Line Tools installed
- .NET 6.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio for Mac or JetBrains Rider (recommended IDEs)

To install XCode Command Line Tools, run the following in Terminal:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Architecture Support

The VisioForge SDK for macOS supports both major processor architectures:

### Intel (x64) Support

- Compatible with all Intel-based Mac computers
- Uses native x64 libraries for optimal performance
- Full feature support across all SDK components

### Apple Silicon (ARM64) Support

- Native support for M1, M2, and newer Apple Silicon chips
- Optimized ARM64 native libraries for maximum performance
- Hardware acceleration leveraging Apple's Neural Engine where applicable

### Universal Binary Considerations

When targeting both architectures, consider building universal binaries that include both x64 and ARM64 code. This approach ensures your application runs natively on either platform without relying on Rosetta 2 translation.

For universal binary builds targeting both Intel and Apple Silicon:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <RuntimeIdentifiers>osx-x64;osx-arm64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
  <UseHardenedRuntime>true</UseHardenedRuntime>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Core Technologies

VisioForge .NET SDKs leverage several key technologies to deliver high-performance media capabilities on macOS:

### GStreamer Integration

All VisioForge SDKs utilize GStreamer as the underlying framework for video/audio playback and encoding. GStreamer provides:

- Hardware-accelerated media processing
- Broad format compatibility
- Optimized playback pipeline
- Efficient encoding capabilities

The GStreamer components are automatically installed through our redistributable packages, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

## Installation and NuGet Package Deployment

The primary method for deploying VisioForge SDK components to macOS applications is through NuGet packages. These packages include all necessary managed and unmanaged libraries required for your application.

### Essential NuGet Packages

For native macOS applications, add these core packages:

1. **Main SDK Package** (based on your needs):
   - `VisioForge.DotNet.VideoCapture` for camera capture applications
   - `VisioForge.DotNet.VideoEdit` for video editing applications
   - `VisioForge.DotNet.MediaPlayer` for media playback applications
   - `VisioForge.DotNet.MediaBlocks` for advanced media processing pipelines

2. **UI Package**:
   - `VisioForge.DotNet.Core` includes Apple-specific UI controls

3. **Platform Redistributable**:
   - `VisioForge.CrossPlatform.Core.macOS` for native libraries and dependencies

### macOS Applications

For standard macOS applications targeting the `netX.0-macos` framework (where X represents the .NET version), use the following NuGet package:

- [VisioForge.CrossPlatform.Core.macOS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.CrossPlatform.Core.macOS)

This package contains:

- Native libraries for media processing
- GStreamer components for media playback and encoding
- Interface assemblies for .NET integration
- Both x64 and ARM64 binaries

### Getting Started with Native macOS Projects

To begin developing native macOS applications with VisioForge SDKs:

1. **Create a new macOS project** in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio for Mac or JetBrains Rider)
2. **Add required NuGet packages** (as detailed above)
3. **Configure project settings** for your target architecture

## MacCatalyst and MAUI Applications

### Cross-Platform Development with .NET MAUI

.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) enables developing applications that run seamlessly across macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows from a single codebase. VisioForge provides comprehensive support for MAUI development through specialized packages and controls.

For MacCatalyst applications (including MAUI projects) targeting the `netX.0-maccatalyst` framework, use:

- [VisioForge.CrossPlatform.Core.macCatalyst](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.CrossPlatform.Core.macCatalyst)

### MAUI Package Configuration

For MAUI projects targeting macOS (through MacCatalyst), add these packages:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="$(TargetFramework.Contains('-maccatalyst'))">
  <PackageReference Include="VisioForge.CrossPlatform.Core.macCatalyst" Version="15.10.11" />
  <PackageReference Include="VisioForge.DotNet.Core.UI.MAUI" Version="15.10.11" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### MAUI Project Setup

1. **Initialize SDK in MauiProgram.cs**:

```csharp
builder
  .UseMauiApp<App>()
  .UseSkiaSharp()
  .ConfigureMauiHandlers(handlers => handlers.AddVisioForgeHandlers());
```

2. **Add VideoView Control in XAML**:

```xml
xmlns:vf="clr-namespace:VisioForge.Core.UI.MAUI;assembly=VisioForge.Core.UI.MAUI"

<vf:VideoView Grid.Row="0"
              HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand"
              VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand"
              x:Name="videoView"
              Background="Black"/>
```

MacCatalyst applications require additional configuration to ensure native libraries are properly included in the application bundle. Add the following custom build target to your project file:

```xml
<Target Name="CopyNativeLibrariesToMonoBundle" AfterTargets="Build" Condition="$(TargetFramework.Contains('-maccatalyst'))">
    <Message Text="Starting CopyNativeLibrariesToMonoBundle target..." Importance="High"/>

    <PropertyGroup>
        <AppBundleDir>$(OutputPath)$(AssemblyName).app</AppBundleDir>
        <MonoBundleDir>$(AppBundleDir)/Contents/MonoBundle</MonoBundleDir>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <Message Text="AppBundleDir: $(AppBundleDir)" Importance="High"/>
    <Message Text="MonoBundleDir: $(MonoBundleDir)" Importance="High"/>

    <MakeDir Directories="$(MonoBundleDir)" Condition="!Exists('$(MonoBundleDir)')"/>

    <Copy SourceFiles="@(None-&gt;'%(FullPath)')" DestinationFolder="$(MonoBundleDir)" Condition="'%(Extension)' == '.dylib' Or '%(Extension)' == '.so'">
        <Output TaskParameter="CopiedFiles" ItemName="CopiedNativeFiles"/>
    </Copy>

    <Message Text="Copied native files:" Importance="High" Condition="@(CopiedNativeFiles) != ''"/>
    <Message Text=" - %(CopiedNativeFiles.Identity)" Importance="High" Condition="@(CopiedNativeFiles) != ''"/>

    <Message Text="Finished CopyNativeLibrariesToMonoBundle target." Importance="High"/>
</Target>
```

This target performs several crucial tasks:

1. Identifies the application bundle directory
2. Creates the MonoBundle directory if it doesn't exist
3. Copies all `.dylib` and `.so` native libraries to the MonoBundle directory
4. Outputs diagnostic information for troubleshooting

For complete MAUI integration details, see our dedicated [MAUI](../install/maui.md) documentation page.

## UI Framework Options

The VisioForge SDK supports multiple UI frameworks for macOS development:

### Native macOS UI

For traditional macOS applications, the SDK provides `VideoViewGL` controls that integrate with the native AppKit framework. These controls provide high-performance video rendering using OpenGL.

### MAUI

For cross-platform MAUI applications, use the [VisioForge.DotNet.Core.UI.MAUI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.DotNet.Core.UI.MAUI) package, which provides MAUI-compatible video views.

### Avalonia

For Avalonia UI applications, the [VisioForge.DotNet.Core.UI.Avalonia](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.DotNet.Core.UI.Avalonia) package offers Avalonia-compatible video controls.

## SDK Initialization and Cleanup

X-engines in the VisioForge SDK require explicit initialization and cleanup to manage resources properly:

```csharp
// Initialize SDK at application startup
VisioForge.Core.VisioForgeX.InitSDK();

// Use SDK components...

// Clean up resources before application exit
VisioForge.Core.VisioForgeX.DestroySDK();
```

For asynchronous initialization and cleanup, use the async variants:

```csharp
// Async initialization
await VisioForge.Core.VisioForgeX.InitSDKAsync();

// Async cleanup
await VisioForge.Core.VisioForgeX.DestroySDKAsync();
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Native Library Loading Failures

If your application fails to load native libraries:

1. Verify all required NuGet packages are properly installed
2. Check the application bundle structure to ensure libraries are in the correct location
3. Use the `dtruss` or `otool` commands to diagnose library loading issues
4. Ensure XCode Command Line Tools are properly installed

### MacCatalyst-Specific Issues

For MacCatalyst deployment problems:

1. Verify the CopyNativeLibrariesToMonoBundle target is correctly implemented
2. Check that the MonoBundle directory contains all necessary native libraries
3. Ensure the application has appropriate entitlements for media access

### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance:

1. Enable hardware acceleration when available
2. Adjust video resolution based on device capabilities
3. Close and dispose of SDK objects when no longer needed
