## Overview of Available Packages

Our SDK provides two powerful NuGet packages that deliver robust computer vision capabilities for your applications:

1. **VisioForge CV Package**: Designed specifically for Windows environments
2. **VisioForge CVD Package**: Cross-platform solution that works across multiple operating systems

These packages provide a comprehensive API for integrating computer vision features directly into your .NET applications.

## Deployment Requirements

### Windows-Specific CV Package

#### Installation Process

The Windows-specific CV package is designed for seamless integration:

- Simply install the NuGet package through your preferred package manager
- No additional deployment steps are necessary
- Ready to use immediately after installation

### Cross-Platform CVD Package

Our cross-platform CVD package requires specific configurations based on your operating system:

#### Windows Environment Setup

When deploying on Windows systems:

- Install the NuGet package through Visual Studio or the .NET CLI
- No additional dependencies or configurations are required
- Works out of the box with standard Windows installations

#### Ubuntu Linux Configuration

For Ubuntu Linux systems, install the following dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgdiplus libopenblas-dev libx11-6
```

These packages provide essential functionalities:

- `libgdiplus`: Provides System.Drawing compatibility
- `libopenblas-dev`: Optimizes matrix operations for computer vision algorithms
- `libx11-6`: Handles X Window System protocol client library

#### macOS Setup Instructions

For macOS environments, use Homebrew to install the required dependencies:

```bash
brew cask install xquartz
brew install mono-libgdiplus
```

These components enable:

- XQuartz: Provides X11 functionality on macOS
- mono-libgdiplus: Ensures compatibility with System.Drawing
