This guide details the system requirements and platform compatibility for VisioForge's suite of .NET SDKs, designed for high-performance video processing and playback applications.

## Overview

Unlock powerful cross-platform video capabilities with VisioForge .NET SDKs, fully compatible with Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS. Our SDKs provide robust support for .NET Framework, .NET Core, and modern .NET 5+ (including .NET 8 LTS & .NET 9), enabling seamless integration with WinForms, WPF, WinUI 3, Avalonia, .NET MAUI, and Xamarin. Develop high-performance video applications with familiar C# paradigms across all major operating systems and UI frameworks.

> **Important Note**: While Windows users benefit from our dedicated installer package, developers working on other platforms should utilize the NuGet package distribution method for implementation.

## Development Environment Requirements

The following sections outline the specific requirements for setting up your development environment when working with our SDKs.
