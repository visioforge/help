## Overview

Managing audio volume levels is a critical aspect of video production and editing applications. This guide demonstrates how to implement individual volume controls for separate audio tracks in your .NET application.

## Implementation Details

Setting custom volume levels for audio tracks gives your users more precise control over their audio mix. Each track can have its own independent volume setting, allowing for professional-quality audio balancing.

## Sample Code Implementation

The following C# example shows how to apply a volume envelope effect to an audio track:

```cs
var volume = new AudioVolumeEnvelopeEffect(10);
VideoEdit1.Input_AddAudioFile(audioFile, null, 0, new[] { volume });
```

## Understanding the Parameters

- `AudioVolumeEnvelopeEffect(10)`: Creates a volume effect with a value of 10
- `Input_AddAudioFile`: Adds an audio file to your project with the specified volume effect
- The parameters allow for precise control over when and how the volume changes are applied

## Required Dependencies

To implement this functionality, you'll need the following redistributable packages:

- Video Edit SDK redistributables:
  - [x86 package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.DotNet.Core.Redist.VideoEdit.x86/)
  - [x64 package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.DotNet.Core.Redist.VideoEdit.x64/)

## Deployment Information

For information about installing or deploying the required components to your end users' systems, please refer to our [deployment guide](../deployment.md).
