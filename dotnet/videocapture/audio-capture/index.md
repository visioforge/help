# Audio Capture for .NET Developers

[!badge size="xl" target="blank" variant="info" text="Video Capture SDK .Net"](https://www.visioforge.com/video-capture-sdk-net)

## Introduction to Audio Capture

Our SDK provides robust audio capture capabilities designed specifically for .NET developers. Whether you're building a professional recording application, adding voice chat to your software, or creating a podcasting tool, our audio capture components deliver exceptional performance and flexibility.

The audio capture functionality lets you record from any audio input device on the system, including microphones, line-in ports, and virtual audio devices. All processing is optimized for minimal CPU usage while maintaining pristine audio quality.

## Supported Audio Sources

The SDK supports capturing from multiple audio sources:

- **Physical microphones** - Desktop, USB, and Bluetooth microphones
- **Line-in ports** - For capturing from external mixers or instruments
- **Virtual audio devices** - Capture audio from other applications 
- **System audio** - Record what's playing through your speakers
- **Network streams** - Capture audio from RTSP, HTTP, and other streaming sources

## Audio Format Support

Our SDK allows you to capture and encode audio in various industry-standard formats to meet any requirement:

### Lossy Formats

- [MP3](../../general/audio-encoders/mp3.md) - Industry standard compressed audio with adjustable bitrates from 8kbps to 320kbps
- [M4A (AAC)](../../general/audio-encoders/aac.md) - Advanced Audio Coding with excellent quality-to-size ratio
- [Windows Media Audio](../../general/audio-encoders/wma.md) - Microsoft's audio format with good compression and Windows integration
- [Ogg Vorbis](../../general/audio-encoders/vorbis.md) - Free and open-source format with excellent quality at lower bitrates
- [Speex](../../general/audio-encoders/speex.md) - Optimized for speech with good quality at very low bitrates

### Lossless Formats

- [WAV](../../general/audio-encoders/wav.md) - Uncompressed audio with perfect quality and wide compatibility
- [FLAC](../../general/audio-encoders/flac.md) - Free Lossless Audio Codec providing compression without quality loss

## Key Features

### Device Control

- Enumerate all available audio input devices
- Select specific input devices programmatically
- Set input volume levels and mute status
- Monitor audio levels in real-time
- Auto-select default system devices

### Advanced Processing

- Real-time audio visualization with spectrum and waveform analysis
- Noise reduction and echo cancellation
- Gain control and normalization
- Voice activity detection (VAD)
- Stereo/mono channel management
- Sample rate conversion

### Recording Controls

- Start, pause, resume, and stop recording
- Buffer management for low-latency operation
- Timed recordings with automatic stop
- File splitting for large recordings
- Auto file naming with timestamps
- Recording profiles for quick setup

## Best Practices

For optimal audio capture in your applications:

1. **Always check device availability** before starting capture
2. **Monitor audio levels** during recording to detect silence or clipping
3. **Use appropriate formats** based on your quality and file size requirements
4. **Implement error handling** for device disconnection events
5. **Provide visual feedback** to users during recording
6. **Test on various hardware** to ensure compatibility
7. **Apply noise reduction** only when needed as it can affect audio quality

## Audio Capture Integration

The audio capture component integrates seamlessly with other SDK elements:

- Combine with video capture for complete AV recording
- Mix with audio playback for call recording applications
- Use with streaming components for live broadcasting
- Integrate with timeline editor for basic audio editing
- Pair with file conversion for post-processing workflows

## Performance Considerations

The SDK is optimized for efficiency, but here are some tips for best performance:

- Lower sample rates (44.1kHz vs 48kHz) reduce CPU usage
- Mono recording uses less processing power than stereo
- MP3 encoding is more CPU-intensive than WAV recording
- Higher bitrates require more processing power
- Buffer sizes affect latency and stability
