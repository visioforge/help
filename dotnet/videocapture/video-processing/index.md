## Transform Your Video Content with Powerful Processing Tools

Our .NET SDK offers developers a complete toolkit for modifying and enhancing video streams during the capture process. With our robust API, you can implement professional-grade video manipulations with minimal code.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Dynamic Resizing and Cropping

Precisely control your video dimensions to match any requirement. Our SDK enables you to:

- Adjust resolution on-the-fly to optimize for different platforms
- Crop unwanted areas from your video frame
- Maintain aspect ratios or create custom dimensions
- Scale content proportionally for different screen sizes

### Professional Overlay System

Enhance your videos with rich content overlays:

- **Text Overlays**: Add customizable captions, titles, timestamps, or any text element with precise control over fonts, colors, positioning, and animations
- **Image Overlays**: Incorporate logos, watermarks, or informational graphics with transparency support
- **Animated GIF Integration**: Embed animated elements that bring movement and visual interest to static scenes

### Advanced Color Manipulation

Fine-tune the visual characteristics of your video with our color adjustment tools:

- Modify brightness, contrast, and gamma for perfect exposure
- Adjust hue and saturation to create specific moods or correct color issues
- Apply color balance adjustments for professional-looking results
- Create custom color grading profiles for consistent visual styling

### Creative Effects Library

Transform ordinary footage with our collection of real-time effects:

- Apply sepia, grayscale, or noir filters for artistic expression
- Use fish-eye, barrel distortion, or other perspective effects
- Implement blur, sharpen, or other focus-based modifications
- Create picture-in-picture and custom compositing effects
