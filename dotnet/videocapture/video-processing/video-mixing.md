# Mixing Multiple Video Streams in .NET Applications

[!badge size="xl" target="blank" variant="info" text="Video Capture SDK .Net"](https://www.visioforge.com/video-capture-sdk-net)

## Introduction to Video Stream Mixing

The SDK provides powerful capabilities for mixing several video streams with different resolutions and frame rates. This functionality is essential for creating professional video applications that require Picture-in-Picture effects, multi-camera views, or combined display outputs.

## Key Features of Video Mixing

- Combine multiple video sources in a single output
- Support for different video resolutions and frame rates
- Multiple layout options (horizontal, vertical, grid, custom)
- Real-time position and parameter adjustments
- Transparency and flip controls
- Support for diverse input sources (cameras, screens, IP cameras)

## VideoCaptureCore engine

The implementation process involves three main steps:

1. Setting up the video mixing mode
2. Adding multiple video sources
3. Configuring and adjusting source parameters

Let's explore each step in detail with code examples.

### Setting Video Mixing Mode

The SDK supports various predefined layouts as well as custom configurations. Select the appropriate mode based on your application requirements.

#### Horizontal Stack Layout

This mode arranges all video sources horizontally in a row:

```cs
VideoCapture1.PIP_Mode = PIPMode.Horizontal;
```

#### Vertical Stack Layout

This mode arranges all video sources vertically in a column:

```cs
VideoCapture1.PIP_Mode = PIPMode.Vertical;
```

#### Grid Layout (2Ã—2)

This mode organizes up to four video sources in a square grid:

```cs
VideoCapture1.PIP_Mode = PIPMode.Mode2x2;
```

#### Custom Layout with Specific Resolution

For advanced scenarios, you can define a custom layout with precise output dimensions:

```cs
VideoCapture1.PIP_Mode = PIPMode.Custom;
VideoCapture1.PIP_CustomOutputSize_Set(1920, 1080);
```

### Adding Video Sources

The first configured source serves as the main input, while additional sources can be added using the PIP API.

#### Adding a Video Capture Device

To incorporate a camera or other video capture device:

```cs
VideoCapture1.PIP_Sources_Add_VideoCaptureDevice(
    deviceName,
    format,
    false,
    frameRate,
    input,
    left,
    top,
    width,
    height);
```

#### Adding an IP Camera Source

For network-based cameras:

```cs
var ipCameraSource= new IPCameraSourceSettings
{
    URL = "camera url"
};

// Set additional IP camera parameters as needed
// Authentication, protocol, buffering, etc.

VideoCapture1.PIP_Sources_Add_IPCamera(
    ipCameraSource,
    left,
    top,
    width,
    height);
```

#### Adding a Screen Capture Source

To include desktop or application windows:

```cs
ScreenCaptureSourceSettings screenSource = new ScreenCaptureSourceSettings();
screenSource.Mode = ScreenCaptureMode.Screen;
screenSource.FullScreen = true;
VideoCapture1.PIP_Sources_Add_ScreenSource(
    screenSource,
    left,
    top,
    width,
    height);
```

### Dynamic Source Adjustments

A major advantage of the SDK is the ability to adjust source parameters in real-time during operation.

#### Repositioning Sources

You can modify the position and dimensions of any source:

```cs
await VideoCapture1.PIP_Sources_SetSourcePositionAsync(
    index,  // 0 is main source, 1+ are additional sources
    left,
    top,
    width,
    height);
```

#### Adjusting Visual Properties

Fine-tune the appearance with transparency and orientation controls:

```cs
int transparency = 127; // Range: 0-255
bool flipX = false;
bool flipY = false;

await VideoCapture1.PIP_Sources_SetSourceSettingsAsync(
    index,
    transparency, 
    transparency, 
    flipX, 
    flipY);
```

### Required Dependencies

To use video mixing functionality, ensure you include the appropriate redistributable packages:

- Video capture redistributables:
  - [x86 Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.DotNet.Core.Redist.VideoCapture.x86/)
  - [x64 Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisioForge.DotNet.Core.Redist.VideoCapture.x64/)

## VideoCaptureCoreX engine

The VideoCaptureCoreX engine is a newer version of the VideoCaptureCore engine that provides additional features and improvements.

### Video Mixing with VideoCaptureCoreX

The VideoCaptureCoreX engine offers a more flexible and powerful approach to video mixing through the `VideoMixerSourceSettings` class. This allows for precise control over multiple video sources and their layout.

#### Basic Setup

```cs
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using VisioForge.Core.Types.MediaInfo;
using VisioForge.Core.Types.X.Sources;
using VisioForge.Core.Types.X.VideoCapture;

// Create a video mixer with 1080p resolution at 30fps
var videoMixer = new VideoMixerSourceSettings(1920, 1080, VideoFrameRate.FPS_30);

// Initialize the VideoCaptureCoreX engine
var captureX = new VideoCaptureCoreX();
captureX.Video_Source = videoMixer;
```

#### Adding Multiple Sources

You can add various video sources to the mixer, positioning each one exactly where needed:

```cs
// Add a camera as the first source (full screen background)
var cameraSource = new VideoCaptureDeviceSourceSettings(); 

// Configure camera settings
// ...

var rect = new Rect(0, 0, 1920, 1080);
videoMixer.Add(cameraSource, rect);

// Add a screen capture source in the top-right corner
var screenSource = new ScreenCaptureDX9SourceSettings();
screenSource.CaptureCursor = true;
screenSource.FrameRate = VideoFrameRate.FPS_30;
 
var rect = new Rect(1280, 0, 640, 480);
videoMixer.Add(screenSource, rect);
```

#### Dynamic Source Management

The VideoCaptureCoreX engine allows for real-time modifications to the video mixer:

```cs
// Change the position of a source (index 1, which is the screen capture)
var mixer = _videoCapture.GetSourceMixerControl();
if (mixer != null)
{
    var stream = mixer.Input_Get(1);
    if (stream != null)
    {
        stream.Rectangle = new Rect(0, 0, 1280, 720);
        mixer.Input_Update(1, stream);
    }
}
```

#### Output Configuration

Configure the output destination for your mixed video:

```cs
// Set up MP4 recording
captureX.Outputs_Add(new MP4Output("output.mp4")); 

// Start capturing
await captureX.StartAsync();

// Stop after some time
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
await captureX.StopAsync();
```

### Comparison with VideoCaptureCore Engine

| Feature | VideoCaptureCore | VideoCaptureCoreX |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
