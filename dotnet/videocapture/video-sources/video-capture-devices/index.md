# Integrating Video Capture Devices in .NET Applications

[Video Capture SDK .Net](https://www.visioforge.com/video-capture-sdk-net){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" }

## Getting Started with Video Capture Devices

Integrating video capture functionality into your .NET applications requires understanding several key concepts and implementation techniques. This guide walks you through the essential components needed for successful device integration.

## Core Device Management Features

### Device Discovery and Selection

* [**Enumerate devices and select**](enumerate-and-select.md) - Learn techniques for scanning available hardware, listing compatible devices, and implementing selection logic in your application.

### Advanced Camera Controls

* [**Camera control and PTZ**](camera-control-ptz.md) - Implement pan-tilt-zoom functionality and other advanced camera movement controls for precision video capture.

### Video Quality Management

* [**Video adjustments**](video-adjustments.md) - Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation and other visual parameters to optimize video quality programmatically.

### Hardware Light Control

* [**Enable camera light**](enable-camera-light.md) - Control integrated lighting systems on compatible camera hardware through your application code.

### Input Configuration

* [**Select device input (configure crossbar)**](crossbar.md) - Configure input sources and manage signal routing for devices with multiple input capabilities.
