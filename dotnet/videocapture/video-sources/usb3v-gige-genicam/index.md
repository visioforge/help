## Overview

Industrial cameras using USB3 Vision, GigE Vision, and GenICam standards provide superior image quality and performance for machine vision applications. Our SDK enables seamless integration with these professional camera types through various connectivity options.

## GigE Vision Protocol

GigE Vision is an industrial camera interface standard based on Gigabit Ethernet technology. It offers several advantages for machine vision applications:

- **High-speed data transfer**: Supports up to 1 Gbps on standard GigE networks and 10+ Gbps on modern 10GigE networks
- **Long cable length**: Can operate at distances up to 100 meters using standard Ethernet cabling
- **Network architecture**: Multiple cameras can share the same network infrastructure
- **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Cameras can receive power through the same Ethernet cable (when using PoE-enabled switches)
- **Device discovery**: Automatic detection of GigE Vision cameras on the network
- **Multicast capabilities**: Allows streaming to multiple clients simultaneously

GigE Vision combines the GenICam programming interface with GigE transport layer, providing consistent command structures across different manufacturers' cameras.

## USB3 Vision Protocol

USB3 Vision is a camera interface standard that leverages the high-speed USB 3.0 interface for industrial imaging applications:

- **High bandwidth**: Up to 5 Gbps theoretical transfer rate, enabling high resolution and frame rates
- **Plug-and-play**: Simple connectivity without specialized interface cards
- **Hot-swappable**: Devices can be connected or disconnected without system reboot
- **Cable length**: Typically supports distances up to 5 meters (can be extended with active cables)
- **Power delivery**: Up to 4.5W provided directly through the USB connection
- **Standard driver architecture**: Uses standard USB drivers from operating systems

USB3 Vision works alongside the GenICam standard to provide consistent camera control across different manufacturers.

## DirectShow Driver Support

Most industrial camera manufacturers include DirectShow-compatible drivers with their development kits. These drivers create a bridge between the camera's native interface and the DirectShow framework, allowing our SDK to access and control these specialized devices.

Key benefits:

- Simplified integration path
- Full access to camera streams
- Compatibility with existing DirectShow workflows

## Cross-Platform GenICam Support

For developers working in multi-platform environments, our SDK's cross-platform engine supports cameras implementing the unified GenICam interface standard. This provides consistent access to camera features across different operating systems.

## Compatible SDKs from Major Manufacturers

The following manufacturer SDKs are known to work well with our integration:

- [Basler pylon SDK](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/software/pylon/sdk/) - Comprehensive toolkit for Basler cameras
- [FLIR/Teledyne Spinnaker SDK](https://www.flir.eu/products/spinnaker-sdk/?vertical=machine+vision&segment=iis) - Advanced imaging solution for FLIR and Teledyne cameras

## Implementation Examples

For practical implementation examples demonstrating how to integrate these camera types with our SDK, we recommend exploring our sample projects.
