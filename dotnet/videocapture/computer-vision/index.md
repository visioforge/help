# Computer Vision Integration for .NET Applications

[!badge size="xl" target="blank" variant="info" text="Video Capture SDK .Net"](https://www.visioforge.com/video-capture-sdk-net)

## Overview

Our SDK provides powerful built-in computer vision capabilities that enable developers to enhance their applications with intelligent video analysis features. These functionalities allow your software to automatically detect and track various elements in video streams including human faces, general objects, vehicles, and pedestrians in real-time.

## Key Computer Vision Modules

The SDK offers multiple specialized detection modules to address various use cases:

* **PedestrianDetector** - Track and count people moving through video frames
* **ObjectDetector** - Identify and classify common objects within video content
* **FaceDetector** - Locate and analyze human faces, supporting security and UX applications
* **CarCounter** - Monitor and quantify vehicle traffic in transportation scenarios

Each module is optimized for performance and accuracy, allowing for reliable real-time processing even on standard hardware configurations.

## Implementation Resources

Developers can access complete working examples in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/visioforge/.Net-SDK-s-samples/tree/master/Video%20Capture%20SDK/WinForms/CSharp/Computer%20Vision). These samples demonstrate practical implementation patterns and best practices for integrating computer vision capabilities into .NET applications.

## Advanced Features

* [Face detection](face-detection.md) - Learn about facial recognition, landmark detection, and emotion analysis
* Machine learning integration
* Custom detection model support
* Multi-threading optimization techniques
