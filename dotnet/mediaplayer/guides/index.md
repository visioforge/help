## Available Guides

This curated collection of guides addresses specific advanced functionalities within the Media Player SDK .Net. Each guide provides practical instructions and insights to help you implement complex features effectively.

### Playback Control & Features

Explore specialized guides on controlling media playback with advanced features.

* [**Loop Mode and Position Range Playback**](loop-and-position-range.md) - Master loop playback and custom start-stop position (segment playback) features for both MediaPlayerCore (DirectShow) and MediaPlayerCoreX (GStreamer) engines. This comprehensive guide covers automatic restart when media reaches the end, playing specific segments between start and stop positions, and combining both for continuous segment loops. Learn how to implement video loops for kiosks or displays, create preview playback windows, test specific portions of media files, and build seamless background video loops. The guide includes detailed property references, events, code examples, best practices, troubleshooting tips, and a comparison table between both engines to help you choose the right approach for your application.
