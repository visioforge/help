[!badge size="xl" target="blank" variant="info" text="Media Player SDK .Net"](https://www.visioforge.com/media-player-sdk-net)

Media Player SDK .Net is a video player SDK with a wide range of features.

SDK can use several decoding engines to play video and audio files, such as FFMPEG, VLC, and DirectShow. Most of the video and audio formats are supported by the FFMPEG engine.

You can play files, network streams, 360-degree videos, and, optionally, DVD and Blu-Ray disks.

## Features

- Video and audio playback
- Video effects
- Audio effects
- Text overlays
- Image overlays
- SVG overlays
- Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, and other video adjustments
- Sepia, pixelate, grayscale, and other video filters

You can check the full list of features on the [product page](https://www.visioforge.com/media-player-sdk-net).

## Sample applications

You can use WPF code in WinForms applications and vice versa. Most of code is the same for all UI frameworks, including Avalonia and MAUI. The main difference is the VideoView control available for each UI framework.
