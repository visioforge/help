[!badge size="xl" target="blank" variant="info" text="Media Blocks SDK .Net"](https://www.visioforge.com/media-blocks-sdk-net)

## Introduction to Audio Rendering

The Audio Renderer Block serves as a critical component in media processing pipelines, enabling applications to output audio streams to sound devices across multiple platforms. This versatile block handles the complex task of converting digital audio data into audible sound through the appropriate hardware interfaces, making it an essential tool for developers building audio-enabled applications.

Audio rendering requires careful management of hardware resources, buffer settings, and timing synchronization to ensure smooth, uninterrupted playback. This block abstracts these complexities and provides a unified interface for audio output across diverse computing environments.

## Core Functionality

The Audio Renderer Block accepts uncompressed audio streams and outputs them to either the default audio device or a user-selected alternative. It provides essential audio playback controls including:

- Volume adjustment with precise decibel control
- Mute functionality for silent operation
- Device selection from available system audio outputs
- Buffering settings to optimize for latency or stability

These capabilities allow developers to create applications with professional-grade audio output without needing to implement platform-specific code for each target operating system.

## Underlying Technology

### Platform-Specific Implementation

The `AudioRendererBlock` supports various platform-specific audio rendering technologies. It can be configured to use a specific audio device and API (see Device Management section). When instantiated using its default constructor (e.g., `new AudioRendererBlock()`), it attempts to select a suitable default audio API based on the operating system:

- **Windows**: The default constructor typically uses DirectSound. The block supports multiple audio APIs including:
  - DirectSound: Provides low-latency output with broad compatibility
  - WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API): Offers exclusive mode for highest quality
  - ASIO (Audio Stream Input/Output): Professional-grade audio with minimal latency for specialized hardware
- **macOS**: Utilizes the CoreAudio framework. The default constructor will typically select a CoreAudio-based device for:
  - High-resolution audio output
  - Native integration with macOS audio subsystem
  - Support for audio units and professional equipment
  (Note: Similarly for macOS, an `OSXAudioSinkBlock` is available for direct interaction with the platform-specific GStreamer sink if needed for specialized scenarios.)
- **Linux**: Implements ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). The default constructor will typically select an ALSA-based device for:
  - Direct hardware access
  - Comprehensive device support
  - Integration with the Linux audio stack
- **iOS**: Employs CoreAudio, optimized for mobile. The default constructor will typically select a CoreAudio-based device, enabling features like:
  - Power-efficient rendering
  - Background audio capabilities
  - Integration with iOS audio session management
  (Note: For developers requiring more direct control over the iOS-specific GStreamer sink or having advanced use cases, the SDK also provides `IOSAudioSinkBlock` as a distinct media block.)
- **Android**: Defaults to using OpenSL ES to provide:
  - Low-latency audio output
  - Hardware acceleration when available

## OSXAudioSinkBlock: Direct macOS Audio Output

The `OSXAudioSinkBlock` is a platform-specific media block designed for advanced scenarios where direct interaction with the macOS GStreamer audio sink is required. This block is useful for developers who need low-level control over audio output on macOS devices, such as custom device selection or integration with other native components.

### Key Features

- Direct access to the macOS audio sink
- Device selection via `DeviceID`
- Suitable for specialized or professional audio applications on macOS

### Settings: `OSXAudioSinkSettings`

The `OSXAudioSinkBlock` requires an `OSXAudioSinkSettings` object to specify the audio output device. The `OSXAudioSinkSettings` class allows you to define:

- `DeviceID`: The ID of the macOS audio output device (starting from 0)

Example:

```csharp
using VisioForge.Core.Types.X.Sinks;

// Select the first available audio device (DeviceID = 0)
var osxSettings = new OSXAudioSinkSettings { DeviceID = 0 };

// Create the macOS audio sink block
var osxAudioSink = new OSXAudioSinkBlock(osxSettings);
```

### Availability Check

You can check if the `OSXAudioSinkBlock` is available on the current platform:

```csharp
bool isAvailable = OSXAudioSinkBlock.IsAvailable();
```

### Integration Example

Below is a minimal example of integrating `OSXAudioSinkBlock` into a media pipeline:

```csharp
var pipeline = new MediaBlocksPipeline();

// Set up your audio source block as needed
var audioSourceBlock = new VirtualAudioSourceBlock(new VirtualAudioSourceSettings());

// Define settings for the sink
var osxSettings = new OSXAudioSinkSettings { DeviceID = 0 };
var osxAudioSink = new OSXAudioSinkBlock(osxSettings);

// Connect the source to the macOS audio sink
pipeline.Connect(audioSourceBlock.Output, osxAudioSink.Input);

await pipeline.StartAsync();
```

## IOSAudioSinkBlock: Direct iOS Audio Output

The `IOSAudioSinkBlock` is a platform-specific media block designed for advanced scenarios where direct interaction with the iOS GStreamer audio sink is required. This block is useful for developers who need low-level control over audio output on iOS devices, such as custom audio routing, format handling, or integration with other native components.

### Key Features

- Direct access to the iOS GStreamer audio sink
- Fine-grained control over audio format, sample rate, and channel count
- Suitable for specialized or professional audio applications on iOS

### Settings: `AudioInfoX`

The `IOSAudioSinkBlock` requires an `AudioInfoX` object to specify the audio format. The `AudioInfoX` class allows you to define:

- `Format`: The audio sample format (e.g., `AudioFormatX.S16LE`, `AudioFormatX.F32LE`, etc.)
- `SampleRate`: The sample rate in Hz (e.g., 44100, 48000)
- `Channels`: The number of audio channels (e.g., 1 for mono, 2 for stereo)

Example:

```csharp
using VisioForge.Core.Types.X;

// Define audio format: 16-bit signed little-endian, 44100 Hz, stereo
var audioInfo = new AudioInfoX(AudioFormatX.S16LE, 44100, 2);

// Create the iOS audio sink block
var iosAudioSink = new IOSAudioSinkBlock(audioInfo);
```

### Availability Check

You can check if the `IOSAudioSinkBlock` is available on the current platform:

```csharp
bool isAvailable = IOSAudioSinkBlock.IsAvailable();
```

### Integration Example

Below is a minimal example of integrating `IOSAudioSinkBlock` into a media pipeline:

```csharp
var pipeline = new MediaBlocksPipeline();

// Set up your audio source block as needed
var audioSourceBlock = new VirtualAudioSourceBlock(new VirtualAudioSourceSettings());

// Define audio format for the sink
var audioInfo = new AudioInfoX(AudioFormatX.S16LE, 44100, 2);
var iosAudioSink = new IOSAudioSinkBlock(audioInfo);

// Connect the source to the iOS audio sink
pipeline.Connect(audioSourceBlock.Output, iosAudioSink.Input);

await pipeline.StartAsync();
```

## Technical Specifications

### Block Information

Name: AudioRendererBlock

| Pin direction | Media type | Pins count |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Input audio | uncompressed audio | 1 |

### Audio Format Support

The Audio Renderer Block accepts a wide range of uncompressed audio formats:

- Sample rates: 8kHz to 192kHz
- Bit depths: 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit (floating point)
- Channel configurations: Mono, stereo, and multichannel (up to 7.1 surround)

This flexibility allows developers to work with everything from basic voice applications to high-fidelity music and immersive audio experiences.

## Device Management

### Enumerating Available Devices

The Audio Renderer Block provides straightforward methods to discover and select from available audio output devices on the system using the `GetDevicesAsync` static method:

```csharp
// Get a list of all audio output devices on the current system
var availableDevices = await AudioRendererBlock.GetDevicesAsync();

// Optionally specify the API to use
var directSoundDevices = await AudioRendererBlock.GetDevicesAsync(AudioOutputDeviceAPI.DirectSound);

// Display device information
foreach (var device in availableDevices)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Device: {device.Name}");
}

// Create a renderer with a specific device
var audioRenderer = new AudioRendererBlock(availableDevices[0]);
```

### Default Device Handling

When no specific device is selected, the block automatically routes audio to the system's default output device. The no-parameter constructor attempts to select an appropriate default device based on the platform:

```csharp
// Create with default device
var audioRenderer = new AudioRendererBlock();
```

The block also monitors device status, handling scenarios such as:

- Device disconnection during playback
- Default device changes by the user
- Audio endpoint format changes

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Management

Audio rendering latency is critical for many applications. The block provides configuration options through the `Settings` property and synchronization control via the `IsSync` property:

```csharp
// Control synchronization behavior
audioRenderer.IsSync = true; // Enable synchronization (default)

// Check if a specific API is available on this platform
bool isDirectSoundAvailable = AudioRendererBlock.IsAvailable(AudioOutputDeviceAPI.DirectSound);
```

### Volume and Mute Control

The AudioRendererBlock provides precise volume control and mute functionality:

```csharp
// Set volume (0.0 to 1.0 range)
audioRenderer.Volume = 0.8; // 80% volume

// Get current volume
double currentVolume = audioRenderer.Volume;

// Mute/unmute
audioRenderer.Mute = true; // Mute audio
audioRenderer.Mute = false; // Unmute audio

// Check mute state
bool isMuted = audioRenderer.Mute;
```

### Resource Utilization

The Audio Renderer Block is designed for efficiency, with optimizations for:

- CPU usage during playback
- Memory footprint for buffer management
- Power consumption on mobile devices

## Integration Examples

### Basic Pipeline Setup

The following example demonstrates how to set up a simple audio rendering pipeline using a virtual audio source:

```csharp
var pipeline = new MediaBlocksPipeline();

var audioSourceBlock = new VirtualAudioSourceBlock(new VirtualAudioSourceSettings());

// Create audio renderer with default settings
var audioRenderer = new AudioRendererBlock();
pipeline.Connect(audioSourceBlock.Output, audioRenderer.Input);

await pipeline.StartAsync();
```

### Real-World Audio Pipeline

For a more practical application, here's how to capture system audio and render it:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    SystemAudioSourceBlock-->AudioRendererBlock;
```

```csharp
var pipeline = new MediaBlocksPipeline();

// Capture system audio
var systemAudioSource = new SystemAudioSourceBlock();

// Configure the audio renderer
var audioRenderer = new AudioRendererBlock();
audioRenderer.Volume = 0.8f; // 80% volume

// Connect blocks
pipeline.Connect(systemAudioSource.Output, audioRenderer.Input);

// Start processing
await pipeline.StartAsync();

// Allow audio to play for 10 seconds
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));

// Stop the pipeline
await pipeline.StopAsync();
```
