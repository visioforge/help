## Introduction to Network Streaming

Network streaming enables real-time transmission of audio and video content across the internet or local networks. VisioForge's comprehensive SDKs provide powerful tools for implementing various streaming protocols in your .NET applications, allowing you to create professional-grade broadcasting solutions with minimal development effort.

This guide covers all streaming options available in VisioForge SDKs, including implementation details, best practices, and code examples to help you select the most appropriate streaming technology for your specific requirements.

## Streaming Protocol Overview

VisioForge SDKs support a wide range of streaming protocols, each with unique advantages for different use cases:

### Real-Time Protocols

- **[RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)](rtmp.md)**: Industry-standard protocol for low-latency live streaming, widely used for live broadcasting to CDNs and streaming platforms
- **[RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)](rtsp.md)**: Ideal for IP camera integration and surveillance applications, offering precise control over media sessions
- **[SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)](srt.md)**: Advanced protocol designed for high-quality, low-latency video delivery over unpredictable networks 
- **[NDI (Network Device Interface)](ndi.md)**: Professional-grade protocol for high-quality, low-latency video transmission over local networks

### HTTP-Based Streaming

- **[HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)](hls-streaming.md)**: Apple-developed protocol that breaks streams into downloadable segments, offering excellent compatibility with browsers and mobile devices
- **[HTTP MJPEG Streaming](http-mjpeg.md)**: Simple implementation for streaming motion JPEG over HTTP connections
- **[IIS Smooth Streaming](iis-smooth-streaming.md)**: Microsoft's adaptive streaming technology for delivering media through IIS servers

### Platform-Specific Solutions

- **[Windows Media Streaming (WMV)](wmv.md)**: Microsoft's native streaming format, ideal for Windows-centric deployments
- **[Adobe Flash Media Server](adobe-flash.md)**: Legacy streaming solution for Flash-based applications

### Cloud & Social Media Integration

- **[AWS S3](aws-s3.md)**: Direct streaming to Amazon Web Services S3 storage
- **[YouTube Live](youtube.md)**: Simplified integration with YouTube's live streaming platform
- **[Facebook Live](facebook.md)**: Direct broadcasting to Facebook's streaming service

## Key Components of Network Streaming

### Video Encoders

VisioForge SDKs provide multiple encoding options to balance quality, performance and compatibility:

#### Software Encoders
- **OpenH264**: Cross-platform software-based H.264 encoder
- **AVENC H264**: FFmpeg-based software encoder

#### Hardware-Accelerated Encoders
- **NVENC H264/HEVC**: NVIDIA GPU-accelerated encoding
- **QSV H264/HEVC**: Intel Quick Sync Video acceleration
- **AMF H264/HEVC**: AMD GPU-accelerated encoding
- **Apple Media H264**: macOS-specific hardware acceleration

## Best Practices for Network Streaming

### Performance Optimization

1. **Hardware acceleration**: Leverage GPU-based encoding where available for reduced CPU usage
2. **Resolution and framerate**: Match output to content type (60fps for gaming, 30fps for general content)
3. **Bitrate allocation**: Allocate 80-90% of bandwidth to video and 10-20% to audio

### Network Reliability

1. **Connection testing**: Verify upload speed before streaming
2. **Error handling**: Implement reconnection logic for disrupted streams
3. **Monitoring**: Track streaming metrics in real-time to identify issues

### Quality Assurance

1. **Pre-streaming checks**: Validate encoder settings and output parameters
2. **Quality monitoring**: Regularly check stream quality during broadcast
3. **Platform compliance**: Follow platform-specific requirements (YouTube, Facebook, etc.)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Encoding overload**: If experiencing frame drops, reduce resolution or bitrate
2. **Connection failures**: Verify network stability and server addresses
3. **Audio/video sync**: Ensure proper timestamp synchronization between streams
4. **Platform rejection**: Confirm compliance with platform-specific requirements
5. **Hardware acceleration failures**: Verify driver installation and compatibility

## Conclusion

Network streaming with VisioForge SDKs provides a comprehensive solution for implementing professional-grade media broadcasting in your .NET applications. By understanding the available protocols and following best practices, you can create high-quality streaming experiences for your users across multiple platforms.
