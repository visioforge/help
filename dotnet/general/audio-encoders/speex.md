## Introduction to Speex

Speex is a patent-free audio codec specifically designed for speech encoding in .NET applications. Whether you need to capture, edit, or record audio in C#, Speex provides excellent compression while maintaining voice quality across various bitrates. VisioForge integrates this powerful encoder into its .NET SDKs, offering developers flexible configuration options for speech-based applications. The codec is particularly well-suited for C# developers looking to implement high-quality audio capture and recording features in their applications.

## Core Functionality

The Speex encoder in VisioForge SDKs supports:

- Multiple frequency bands for different quality levels
- Variable and fixed bitrate encoding
- Voice activity detection and silence compression
- Adjustable complexity and quality settings
- Cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Seamless integration with dotnet applications

### Encoder Modes

Speex offers four operation modes optimized for different frequency ranges:

| Mode | Value | Optimal Sample Rate |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Auto | 0 | Automatic selection based on input |
| Ultra Wide Band | 1 | 32 kHz |
| Wide Band | 2 | 16 kHz |
| Narrow Band | 3 | 8 kHz |

The encoder automatically adjusts internal parameters based on the selected mode. For most speech applications, Wide Band (mode 2) offers an excellent balance between quality and bandwidth usage.

## Technical Specifications

### Supported Sample Rates

Speex works with three standard sampling frequencies:

- 8,000 Hz - Best for telephone-quality audio (Narrow Band)
- 16,000 Hz - Recommended for most voice applications (Wide Band)
- 32,000 Hz - Highest quality speech encoding (Ultra Wide Band)

### Channel Configuration

The encoder handles both:

- Mono (1 channel) - Ideal for speech recordings
- Stereo (2 channels) - For multi-speaker or immersive audio

## Rate Control Methods

### Quality-Based Encoding

For consistent perceptual quality, use the `Quality` parameter:

```csharp
var settings = new SpeexEncoderSettings {
    Quality = 8.0f, // Range from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest)
    VBR = false     // Fixed quality mode
};
```

Higher quality values produce better audio at the expense of increased file size. Most speech applications work well with quality values between 5-8.

### Variable Bit Rate (VBR)

VBR dynamically adjusts the bitrate based on speech complexity:

```csharp
var settings = new SpeexEncoderSettings {
    VBR = true,
    Quality = 8.0f  // Target quality level
};
```

This approach typically saves bandwidth while maintaining consistent perceived quality, making it ideal for streaming applications.

### Average Bit Rate (ABR)

ABR maintains a target bitrate over time while allowing quality fluctuations:

```csharp
var settings = new SpeexEncoderSettings {
    ABR = 15.0f,   // Target bitrate in kbps
    VBR = true     // Required for ABR mode
};
```

This option works well when you need predictable file sizes or bandwidth usage.

### Fixed Bitrate Encoding

For consistent data rates throughout the encoding process:

```csharp
var settings = new SpeexEncoderSettings {
    Bitrate = 24.6f,  // Fixed rate in kbps
    VBR = false
};
```

Supported bitrates range from 2.15 kbps to 24.6 kbps:

- 2.15 kbps - Ultra-compressed speech (limited quality)
- 3.95 kbps - Low bandwidth voice
- 5.95 kbps - Basic speech clarity
- 8.00 kbps - Standard voice quality
- 11.0 kbps - Good speech reproduction
- 15.0 kbps - Near-transparent speech
- 18.2 kbps - High-quality voice
- 24.6 kbps - Maximum quality speech

## Voice Optimization Features

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

VAD identifies the presence of speech in audio signals:

```csharp
var settings = new SpeexEncoderSettings {
    VAD = true,    // Enable voice detection
    DTX = true     // Recommended with VAD
};
```

This feature improves bandwidth efficiency by focusing encoding resources on actual speech segments.

### Discontinuous Transmission (DTX)

DTX reduces data transmission during silence periods:

```csharp
var settings = new SpeexEncoderSettings {
    DTX = true     // Enable silence compression
};
```

For VoIP and real-time communications, enabling DTX can significantly reduce bandwidth requirements.

### Encoding Complexity

Control CPU usage versus encoding quality:

```csharp
var settings = new SpeexEncoderSettings {
    Complexity = 3  // Range: 1 (fastest) to 10 (highest quality)
};
```

Lower values prioritize speed and reduce CPU load, while higher values improve audio quality at the cost of performance.

## Implementation Examples

### Checking Encoder Availability

Always verify encoder availability before implementing Speex in your C# application:

```csharp
if (!SpeexEncoderSettings.IsAvailable())
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Speex encoder not available on this system.");
}
```

### Basic Configuration for Audio Capture

Here's how to set up basic Speex encoding for audio capture in dotnet:

```csharp
var encoderSettings = new SpeexEncoderSettings
{
    Mode = SpeexEncoderMode.WideBand,
    SampleRate = 16000,
    Channels = 1,
    Quality = 7.0f
};
```

### Optimized for Voice Recording

For voice recording applications in .NET, use these optimized settings:

```csharp
var voipSettings = new SpeexEncoderSettings
{
    Mode = SpeexEncoderMode.WideBand,
    SampleRate = 16000,
    Channels = 1,
    VBR = true,
    VAD = true,
    DTX = true,
    Quality = 6.0f,
    Complexity = 4
};
```

### Highest Quality Audio Capture

For maximum quality audio capture in dotnet:

```csharp
var highQualitySettings = new SpeexEncoderSettings
{
    Mode = SpeexEncoderMode.UltraWideBand,
    SampleRate = 32000,
    Channels = 2,
    Bitrate = 24.6f,
    Complexity = 8
};
```

## Performance Optimization

When implementing Speex encoding, consider these optimization strategies:

1. **Match sample rate to content** - Use Narrow Band (8 kHz) for telephone audio, Wide Band (16 kHz) for most voice applications, and Ultra Wide Band (32 kHz) only when maximum quality is required

2. **Enable VBR with VAD/DTX** for speech content - This combination provides optimal bandwidth efficiency for typical voice recordings

3. **Adjust complexity based on platform** - Mobile applications may benefit from lower complexity values (2-4), while desktop applications can use higher values (5-8)

4. **Use ABR for streaming** - Average Bit Rate provides predictable bandwidth usage while maintaining quality flexibility

5. **Test different quality settings** - Often a quality setting of 5-7 provides excellent results without excessive file size
