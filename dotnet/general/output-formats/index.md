## Introduction

The VisioForge .NET SDKs support a wide range of output formats for video, audio, and media projects. Selecting the right format is crucial for ensuring compatibility, optimizing file size, and maintaining quality appropriate for your target platform. This guide covers all available formats, their technical specifications, use cases, and implementation details to help developers make informed decisions.

## Choosing the Right Format

When selecting an output format, consider these key factors:

- **Target platform** - Some formats work better on specific devices or browsers
- **Quality requirements** - Different codecs provide varying levels of quality at different bitrates
- **File size constraints** - Some formats offer better compression than others
- **Processing overhead** - Encoding complexity varies between formats
- **Streaming requirements** - Certain formats are optimized for streaming scenarios

## Video Container Formats

### AVI (Audio Video Interleave)

[AVI](avi.md) is a classic container format developed by Microsoft that supports various video and audio codecs.

**Key features:**

- Wide compatibility with Windows applications
- Supports virtually any DirectShow-compatible video and audio codec
- Simple structure makes it reliable for video editing workflows
- Better suited for archiving than streaming

### MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14)

[MP4](mp4.md) is one of the most versatile and widely used container formats in modern applications.

**Key features:**

- Excellent compatibility across devices and platforms
- Supports advanced codecs including H.264, H.265/HEVC, and AAC
- Optimized for streaming and progressive download
- Efficient storage with good quality-to-size ratio

**Supported video codecs:**

- H.264 (AVC) - Balance of quality and compatibility
- H.265 (HEVC) - Better compression but higher encoding overhead
- MPEG-4 Part 2 - Older codec with wider compatibility

**Supported audio codecs:**

- AAC - Industry standard for digital audio compression
- MP3 - Widely supported legacy format

### WebM

[WebM](webm.md) is an open-source container format designed specifically for web use.

**Key features:**

- Royalty-free format ideal for web applications
- Native support in most modern browsers
- Excellent for streaming video content
- Supports VP8, VP9, and AV1 video codecs

**Technical considerations:**

- VP9 offers ~50% bitrate reduction compared to H.264 at similar quality
- AV1 provides even better compression but with significantly higher encoding complexity
- Works well with HTML5 video elements without plugins

### MKV (Matroska)

[MKV](mkv.md) is a flexible container format that can hold virtually any type of audio or video.

**Key features:**

- Supports multiple audio, video, and subtitle tracks
- Can contain almost any codec
- Great for archiving and high-quality storage
- Supports chapters and attachments

**Best uses:**

- Media archives requiring multiple tracks
- High-quality video storage
- Projects requiring complex chapter structures

### Additional Container Formats

- [MOV](mov.md) - Apple's QuickTime container format
- [MPEG-TS](mpegts.md) - Transport Stream format optimized for broadcasting
- [MXF](mxf.md) - Material Exchange Format used in professional video production
- [Windows Media Video](wmv.md) - Microsoft's proprietary format

## Audio-Only Formats

### MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III)

[MP3](../audio-encoders/mp3.md) remains one of the most widely supported audio formats.

**Key features:**

- Near-universal compatibility
- Configurable bitrate for quality vs. size tradeoffs
- VBR (Variable Bit Rate) option for optimized file sizes

### AAC in M4A Container

[M4A](../audio-encoders/aac.md) provides better audio quality than MP3 at the same bitrate.

**Key features:**

- Better compression efficiency than MP3
- Good compatibility with modern devices
- Supports advanced audio features like multichannel audio

### Other Audio Formats

- [FLAC](../audio-encoders/flac.md) - Lossless audio format for high-quality archiving
- [OGG Vorbis](../audio-encoders/vorbis.md) - Open-source alternative to MP3 with better quality at lower bitrates

## Specialized Formats

### GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

[GIF](gif.md) is useful for creating short, silent animations.

**Key features:**

- Wide web compatibility
- Limited to 256 colors per frame
- Support for transparency
- Ideal for short, looping animations

### Custom Output Format

[Custom output format](custom.md) allows integration with third-party DirectShow filters.

**Key features:**

- Maximum flexibility for specialized requirements
- Integration with commercial or custom codecs
- Support for proprietary formats

## Advanced Output Options

### FFMPEG Integration

[FFMPEG EXE](ffmpeg-exe.md) integration provides access to FFMPEG's extensive codec library.

**Key features:**

- Support for virtually any format FFMPEG can handle
- Advanced encoding options
- Custom command line arguments for fine-tuned control

## Performance Optimization Tips

When working with video output formats, consider these optimization strategies:

1. **Match format to use case** - Use streaming-optimized formats for web delivery
2. **Consider hardware acceleration** - Many modern codecs support GPU acceleration
3. **Use appropriate bitrates** - Higher isn't always better; find the sweet spot for your content
4. **Test on target devices** - Ensure compatibility before finalizing format choice
5. **Enable multi-threading** - Take advantage of multiple CPU cores for faster encoding

## Implementation Best Practices

- Configure proper keyframe intervals for streaming formats
- Set appropriate bitrate constraints for target platforms
- Use two-pass encoding for highest quality output when time permits
- Consider audio quality requirements alongside video format decisions
