* Resolution upscaling
* Frame rate conversion
* Dynamic contrast adjustment
* HDR tone mapping

## Overlay Capabilities

* [Text overlay](text-overlay.md) - Add customizable text with control over font, size, color, and animation
* [Image overlay](image-overlay.md) - Incorporate logos, watermarks, and graphic elements with transparency support

## Video Processing Features
  
### Transformation Operations

* Rotation, scaling, and cropping
* Picture-in-picture effects
* Custom aspect ratio conversion
* Video composition and layering

### Advanced Processing
